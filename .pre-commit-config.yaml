# Pre-commit hooks configuration - MATCHES GITHUB CI WORKFLOW EXACTLY
#
# NOTE: A git pre-commit hook is already installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
#       which runs these exact checks. This file is maintained for consistency
#       if you prefer to use the pre-commit framework instead.
#
# Install: pre-commit install
# Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
